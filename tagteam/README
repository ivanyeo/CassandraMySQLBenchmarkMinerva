Correct files to use as the golden set now:

tagtable_unique_pairs.txt
    -> tag value as the key and list of pids as values

posttag.txt
    -> (pid, tid) pairs that are unique ... that is
        for every post, if there are duplicate tags,
        the pid will only be recorded once as (pid, tid)
        and not 2 representation of the same (pid, tid)

tag.txt
    -> (tid, value)
